This is the solution of the C++ Usergroup Dresden for the Solitaire Klondike kata.

http://codekata.com/kata/kata20-klondike

The `master` branch contains the partial solution that was created during the coding dojo on 2017-06-8.

The `pragmatic` branch contains a fully working solution. The algorithm that plays the game is intentionally really bad. It wins approx. 10 of 10000 games played.

The `ood` branch contains an implementation of the game rules. Each pile of cards on the game board is a class derived from BasePile and implements the rules.

Feel free to ask questions, comment the code or create pull requests.
